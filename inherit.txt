1.Inheritance is used in a lot of programs because it allows you to reuse code or share functions. It does this by letting the derived classes access functions and variables that are inside a base class. Doing this and reusing code, can make your program run more efficiently and make it look neater from less repetitive lines of code. 
2.Inheritance helps you expand the capabilities of pre-existing classes by introducing new variables and functions within derived classes. Doing this allows you to have access to everything in your base class without the need to change any code on top of all of the functions and variables in your derived class as well.
